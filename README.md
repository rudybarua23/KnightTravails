# KnightTravails

Overview
This project explores solving the Knight's Travails problem on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The goal is to determine the shortest path for a knight to travel from a starting position to a target position. The solution utilizes a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, representing the chessboard as an implicit graph where each position is a node, and valid knight moves are the edges between nodes.

Features
Calculate the shortest path for a knight to move from one square to another on a chessboard.
Visualize the sequence of moves taken by the knight.
Prevent revisiting positions to ensure efficient computation.
Validate moves to ensure they remain within the chessboard boundaries.
